* Added additional test to catch when Zenodo is offline (palaeorotate)
* Added a coords argument to the tax_range_space function to control whether coordinates are returned
* palaeorotate documentation updated to reflect updates to GPlates Web Service (#74)
* MULLER2022 plate rotation model made available in palaeorotate (#74)
* model argument in palaeorotate now allows multiple models to be called - palaeogeographic uncertainty is now calculated on the requested models
* max distance calculations in palaeorotate's uncertainty functionality updated to use geosphere::distGeo
