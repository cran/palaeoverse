\title{Assign fossil occurrences to spatial bins}
\usage{
bin_space(
  occdf,
  lng = "lng",
  lat = "lat",
  spacing = 100,
  sub_grid = NULL,
  return = FALSE,
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of the fossil occurrences (or
localities) you wish to bin. This dataframe should contain the decimal
degree coordinates of your occurrences, and they should be of
class \code{numeric}.}

\item{lng}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input longitude (e.g. "lng" or "p_lng").}

\item{lat}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input latitude (e.g. "lat" or "p_lat").}

\item{spacing}{\code{numeric}. The desired spacing between the center of
adjacent cells. This value should be provided in kilometres.}

\item{sub_grid}{\code{numeric}. For an optional sub-grid, the desired
spacing between the center of adjacent cells in the sub-grid.
This value should be provided in kilometres.
See details for information on sub-grid usage.}

\item{return}{\code{logical}. Should the equal-area grid information and
polygons be returned?}

\item{plot}{\code{logical}. Should the occupied cells of the equal-area grid
be plotted?}
}
\value{
If the \code{return} argument is set to \code{FALSE}, a dataframe is
returned of the original input \code{occdf} with cell information. If \code{return} is
set to \code{TRUE}, a list is returned with both the input \code{occdf} and grid
information and polygons.

\description{
A function to assign fossil occurrences (or localities) to spatial
bins/samples using a hexagonal equal-area grid.
}
\details{
This function assigns fossil occurrence data into
equal-area grid cells using discrete hexagonal grids via the
\code{\link[h3jsr]{h3jsr}} package. This package relies on
\href{https://h3geo.org/docs/}{Uber's H3} library, a geospatial indexing system
that partitions the world into hexagonal cells. In H3, 16 different
resolutions are available
(\href{https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable/}{see here}). In the
implementation of the \code{bin_space()} function, the resolution is defined by
the user-input \code{spacing} which represents the distance between the centroid
of adjacent cells. Using this distance, the function identifies which
resolution is most similar to the input \code{spacing}, and uses this resolution.

Additional functionality allows the user to simultaneously assign occurrence
data to equal-area grid cells of a finer-scale grid (i.e. a ‘sub-grid’)
within the primary grid via the \code{sub_grid} argument. This might be desirable
for users to evaluate the differences in the amount of area occupied by
occurrences within their primary grid cells. This functionality also allows
the user to easily rarefy across sub-grid cells within primary cells to
further standardise spatial sampling (see example for basic implementation).

Note: prior to implementation, coordinate reference system (CRS) for input
data is defined as EPSG:4326 (World Geodetic System
1984). The user should transform their data accordingly if this is
not appropriate. If you are unfamiliar with working with geographic data,
we highly recommend checking out \href{https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/index.html}{Geocomputation with R}.

# Get internal data

# Reduce data for plotting
occdf <- reefs[1:250, ]

# Bin data using a hexagonal equal-area grid

# Load data

# Rarefy data across sub-grid grid cells
# Returns a list with each element a bin with respective mean genus richness
